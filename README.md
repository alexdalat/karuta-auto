# karuta-auto
Automation for the popular discord bot game Karuta.

It uses OCR to capture card details, recieves their details, and makes the best choice on which card to grab.

This project got me hundreds of high wishlist cards (with low quickness and tougnness, granted) throughout quarantine. Intended to be used in a private server.

I can't be bothered but this can be easily optimized by saving queried cards to a database, optimizing speed the next time it shows up.
